  Quizpot
</h1>

An open-source quiz application that allows you to create entertaining quizzes, without limits. 

Based on Next.js, it uses the latest web technologies so it's accessible from your phone to your tv, and it's easy to run anywhere from your local machine or the cloud.

## Why Quizpot?

Quizpot is open-source and free to use, no strings attached. Aiming to be the best in class and easy to use, it's built with the latest technologies and is user oriented.

## Deploy

Deploying Quizpot is as easy as cloning the repository with `git clone https://github.com/quizpot/quizpot` and running `npm i && npm run build && npm run start` then visit it at `http://localhost:3000`. 

Disclaimer: Make sure it's not running in a serverless environment like Vercel since it's running a Websocket server under the hood which will not work in such environments.
